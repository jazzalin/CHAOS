# CHAOS

##Project I started in Grade 11, when I wrote the essay: Introduction to Chaos Theory (FRENCH).
##Chaos theory really piqued my interest as it challenges our way of thinking of reality, especially in regards to the countless dynamical systems that we encounter every day.

##At the moment, a numerical simulation of the double pendulum and a physical double pendulum arein the works.
