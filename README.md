Chaos and the double pendulum
=============================

Overview
--------

* Long term project combining mathematical exploration and numerical analysis
* Started as a high school project about the double pendulum's sensitivity to initial conditions
* A numerical simulation has since been implemented to showcase the double pendulum's chaotic behaviour
* The project served as a basis for exploration of numerical methods, in particular, the 4th order Runge-Kutta method
* The design of a physical double pendulum awaits laser cutting

Motivation
-----------

The dynamics of the double pendulum are well suited for an analysis from first principles. The physics can easily be derived on paper, until the resulting differential equations, being too complex to solve by hand, call for the use of numerical solvers. While symbolic mathematical computation packages can be used to solve the system of differential equations, the problem lends itself to an exploration of numerical analysis with the Runge-Kutta methods.

Frankly, I believe that the motion of the double pendulum makes for a great conversation starter. Whether numerically simulated or physically showcased, **the motion of the double pendulum simply intrigues**.
