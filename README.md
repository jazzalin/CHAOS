# CHAOS

###Overview
######Long term project about the fascinating CHAOS theory. Starting with an essay written in high school about the double pendulum's sensitivity to initial conditions, the project now showcases the chaotic motion of the pendulum's through a numerical simulation. The 4th order Runge-Kutta method was used for the calculations and the python library Plotly was used to generate the streaming plots of the double pendulum in action.
###Motivation
######Chaos theory really piqued my interest as it challenges our way of viewing and thinking about reality, especially the countless dynamical systems that surround us every day.
